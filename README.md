# bioinfoutils
Collection of useful bioinformatics scripts in a mix of perl, bash, and R code. 
Some are under development, read the headers!
Some parameters are hardcoded and meant to be generalized later. If you can't program, you can't use those scripts.

First sets of scripts are to convert HGVS cDNA coordinates into DNA coordinates.
